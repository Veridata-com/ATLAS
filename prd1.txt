📘 PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

PROJECT NAME:
Atlas (working name)

PRODUCT TYPE:
Mobile-first knowledge & guidance app (iOS / Android / Web)

STATUS:
Core app infrastructure already built.
This PRD defines UI/UX, search behavior, content presentation, and refinement layers.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Provide the fastest, most trustworthy path from user confusion → clarity using
science-backed guides, with a Google-like discovery experience and premium readability.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Cognitive load minimization
- Trust through structure and consistency
- Familiar interaction patterns
- Calm, premium, non-distracting UI


⸻

1. USER & PSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATIONS

1.1 Target User Mental State

Users open the app when:
	•	They feel confused, overwhelmed, or uncertain
	•	They want a clear answer, not a conversation
	•	They do NOT want to “research”

Design must:
	•	Reduce anxiety
	•	Reward curiosity immediately
	•	Avoid choice paralysis

⸻

1.2 Science-Backed UX Principles (Applied)

Hick’s Law
→ Fewer choices = faster decisions
→ Limit visible actions per screen

Fitts’s Law
→ Large tappable areas, especially search and categories

Cognitive Fluency
→ Familiar layouts (Google-like results)
→ Consistent typography and spacing

Chunking
→ Content broken into visual sections, not text blocks

Progressive Disclosure
→ Show only what’s needed at each moment

⸻

2. INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (GLOBAL)

2.1 Core Sections
	•	Search (primary)
	•	Categories (secondary)
	•	Saved guides
	•	Settings

NO social feeds
NO timelines
NO infinite scroll outside search results

⸻

3. MAIN SEARCH SCREEN (HOME)

3.1 Layout Structure

[ Header ]
"What do you want to improve?"
Subtext: "Science-backed guides. No noise."

[ Search Bar ]
Full width, immediately focused

[ Category Chips ]
Scrollable, large, tappable

[ Recent / Saved ]
Only if exists


⸻

3.2 Search Bar Requirements
	•	Auto-focus on app open
	•	Single input field
	•	No icons inside input
	•	Soft border or subtle elevation
	•	Keyboard optimized for text input

Placeholder text rotation (randomized):
	•	“Search fat loss, sleep, focus…”
	•	“Type a goal or problem”
	•	“What are you trying to improve today?”

⸻

4. SEARCH SYSTEM (GOOGLE-LIKE BEHAVIOR)

4.1 Core Philosophy

Search results must feel:
	•	Familiar
	•	Predictable
	•	Ranked by relevance, not recency

User expectation:

“The first result is probably what I want.”

⸻

4.2 Search Matching Logic

Inputs:
	•	Guide title
	•	Keywords
	•	Synonyms
	•	Category tags
	•	Partial word matches (error tolerance)

Ranking priority:
	1.	Exact title match
	2.	Keyword relevance score
	3.	Category relevance
	4.	Popularity / saves (if implemented later)

⸻

4.3 Search Results UI (Google-Inspired)

Each result card contains:

Title (bold, dark)
One-line summary (lighter text)
Meta row:
• Category
• Read time
• Evidence-based label

Example:

Lose fat without losing muscle
Evidence-based strategy for active individuals
Fat Loss • 7 min • Science-backed

⸻

4.4 Search UX Behaviors
	•	Instant results (no “loading” screen)
	•	Typing refines results live
	•	Empty state suggests alternatives:
	•	“Try: sleep, stress, endurance…”

⸻

5. GUIDE VIEW PAGE (READABILITY & DESIGN)

5.1 Visual Philosophy

Goal:

Not “notes app”
Not “blog”
But curated scientific clarity

⸻

5.2 Page Layout

[ Title ]
[ Subheading ]

[ Outcome Card ]
"What you’ll gain from this guide"

[ Content Sections ]
Styled blocks

[ Action Box ]
Clear steps

[ Sources ]
Always visible


⸻

5.3 Design Elements (CRUCIAL)

Section Cards
	•	Light background tint
	•	Rounded corners
	•	Generous padding
	•	Clear headers

Highlight Blocks
Used sparingly:
	•	Key takeaway
	•	Warning
	•	Common mistake

Color rules:
	•	One accent color only
	•	Never more than 2 highlights per screen

⸻

5.4 Typography & Spacing Rules
	•	Max line width (no wide paragraphs)
	•	Large line height
	•	Paragraphs ≤ 3 lines
	•	Bullets preferred over text

⸻

5.5 Action Box (Mandatory)

Always ends with:

IF YOU WANT RESULTS:
✓ Do this
✓ Avoid this
✓ Focus on this

This improves:
	•	Retention
	•	Perceived value
	•	Practical usefulness

⸻

6. CONTENT STANDARDS

6.1 Writing Style
	•	Neutral

	•	Not hidden
	•	Not collapsible

Trust is non-negotiable.

⸻

7. RETENTION MECHANISMS (NON-ANNOYING)

	•	Saved guides
	•	Recently viewed
	•	Gentle reminders (later)

Not allowed:
	•	Push spam
	•	Streak pressure
	•	Gamification

Retention comes from trust, not dopamine tricks.

⸻

8. PERFORMANCE & TECH CONSTRAINTS
	•	Guides stored in database, not bundled in app
